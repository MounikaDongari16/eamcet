Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, sizes, and positions of objects and the relationships between them.

Some key concepts in geometry include:

1. Point: A location in space, represented by a set of coordinates.
2. Line: A set of points that extend infinitely in two directions.
3. Angle: A formed by two lines or a line and a plane that meet at a point.
4. Plane: A flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions.
5. Polygon: A shape with at least three sides.
6. Perimeter: The distance around a shape.
7. Area: The amount of space inside a shape.
8. Circumference: The distance around a circle.
9. Radius: The distance from the center of a circle to the edge.

Now, let's consider a square with a side length of 5 units.

Question: What is the area of a square with a side length of 5 units?

We know that the area of a square is given by the formula: Area = side x side.

So, we can multiply the side length by itself: 5 x 5 = 25 square units.

Therefore, the area of the square is 25 square units.

Introduction:
The term perimeter refers to the distance around a shape, such as the distance around a rectangle or a triangle. On the other hand, the term area refers to the size of the space inside the shape.

Key Concepts:
To understand the concepts of perimeter and area, we need to know about the different shapes involved and the different formulas for calculating perimeter and area of different shapes. Shapes can be broadly classified into two categories - 2D and 3D. However, in EAMCET, we mainly focus on 2D shapes.


Perimeter and Area Formulas:


 Rectangle:
Perimeter: 2l + 2b
Area: l x b
  where l = length and b = breadth


 Circle:
Perimeter: 2 x pi x r
Area: pi x r x r

  where r = radius
 Triangle:
Perimeter: a + b + c
Area: 
        if we know height and base:   (1/2) x base x height
        if we know two sides and the included angle: (1/2) x a x b x sin(angle)
 where a and b are length of two sides


Example Problems:


 Problem 1: Find the perimeter of a rectangle with length 5 cm and breadth 6 cm.


 Solution: First, we need to add both l and b and multiply by 2.  Perimeter  = 2x(5 + 6) = 2x11 =  22 x cm


 Problem 2: A circular garden with radius 4 cm has a path of 1 cm around it.  Find the cost of constructing the path at  Rs.5 per cm. 

 Solution First find the perimeter of garden (without path)  = 2 x 22/7 x 4 = 2 x 8x 22 / 7  = 176/7  cm Then, add the width of the path to get the actual length required for the path  = (176/7) + (3 x 2) = (176 + 42) / 7  = 218/ 7  cm. Multiply it by the cost per cm to get the total cost  = (218 / 7) x 5 = 1090 / 7 Rs.



Problem 3: Find the area of an equilateral triangle with side length of 6 cm. 

 Solution: We need to multiply the square of the side with the square root of 3 over  4 to get the area. Area  = (1/4) sqrt(3) x 6 x 6  = (36 sqrt(3) ) / 4 = 36/4 x sqrt(3) = 9x sqrt(3) cm^2


 Common Mistakes:
We often forget to add or multiply by 2, or to calculate the square root of the area. So be careful, especially for area of triangle problems.


Practice Tip:
To practice problems, start with simple shapes and gradually move on to more complex shapes like triangles.
