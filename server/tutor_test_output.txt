You want to find the perimeter of a square.

To find the perimeter of any shape, we need to add up all its sides.

Now, a square has all sides that are equal in length, and since we are given the side length of 5 cm, we can use that information to find the perimeter.

The formula for the perimeter of a square is P = 4 times the side length.

In your case, the side length of the square is 5 cm. 

P = 4 times 5 
P = 4 x 5 
P = 20

So, the perimeter of the square with a side length of 5 cm is 20 cm.

INTRODUCTION:
The concepts of perimeter and area are fundamental in geometry and frequently appear in the EAMCET examination. Perimeter refers to the distance around a closed shape, while the area is the measure of its size.

These measures have their applications in engineering, construction, and other related fields. Understanding and calculating perimeter and area accurately are essential skills for EAMCET aspirants.


KEY CONCEPTS:

1. Perimeter is calculated by summing the lengths of all sides of a two-dimensional closed figure.
2. The area of basic shapes like squares, rectangles, triangles, and circles can be calculated using specific formulas.
3. Perimeter of a rectangle = 2  (length + width)
4. Area of a rectangle = length x width
5. Perimeter of a square = 4  side
6. Area of a square = side x side
7. Perimeter of a triangle = sum of all three sides
8. Area of a triangle = 1/2  base x height
9. Circumference (C) of a circle = 2  π  radius
10. Area of a circle = π  radius^2


FORMULAE:

1. Formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2  (l + w) or P = 2  length + 2  width 
2. Formula for the area of a rectangle: A = l  w
3. Formula for the perimeter of a square: P = 4  s where s is the length of the side
4. Formula for the area of a square: A = s^2
5. Formula for the perimeter of a triangle: P = a + b + c where a, b, and c are lengths of three sides
6. Formula for the area of a triangle: A = 1/2  b  h where b is the base and h is the height
7. Formula for the circumference of a circle: C = 2  π  r where r is the radius
8. Formula for the area of a circle: A = π  r^2


EXAMPLES:

1. Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle with dimensions: length = 8 meters and width = 5 meters
 Perimeter (P) = 2  (8 + 5) = 2  13 = 26 meters
2. Calculate the area of a square with dimensions: side = 7 meters
 Area (A) = 7  7 = 49 square meters
3. Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 meters and a height of 8 meters
 Area (A) = 1/2  10  8 = 1/2  80 = 40 square meters


COMMON MISTAKES:

1. Incorrectly calculating the perimeter of a rectangle due to incorrect length and width
2. Forgetting to square the radius when calculating the area of a circle
3. Misjudging the length and height when calculating the area of a triangle
4. Calculating the circumference of a circle without using pi (π)
